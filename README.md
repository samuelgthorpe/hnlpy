# hnlpy
<i>Some introductory FFT and EEG examples in python, written initially as part of a mini-course for members of the Human Neuroscience Laboratory (HNL) at UC Irvine.</i>       

hnlpy currently contains two notebooks. The first and most introductory, called FFTex, steps through some basics of using Numpy's fft module and Matplotlib for visualization. The second, EEGex, steps through some FFT examples with simulated EEG data. EEGex also demos how to use ipython with plotly to make interactive plots, how to run matlab inside ipython with the pymatbridge module, as well as how make nice 3d topo-plots using python's Mayavi module.
